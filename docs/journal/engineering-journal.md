### Accomplishments

- **Component Development:**
  - Refactored the rainbow background from a CSS/HTML background image to a dedicated `Rainbow` React component that renders the PNG image.
  - Integrated the `Rainbow` component into the app and visually verified its appearance.
  - Adjusted the layout to wrap the rainbow and AddSpiderButton in a new container for better positioning.
  - Increased the size of the AddSpiderButton for improved visibility.
  - Removed the old `.lower-left` positioning and set up the button for relative positioning within the new layout.
  - Iteratively adjusted CSS to begin improving the button's alignment with the left cloud.

- **Testing:**
  - Created a new test file for the Rainbow component to verify it renders the image with the correct `src` and `alt` attributes.
  - Updated Jest configuration and file mocks to support image imports and ES module compatibility.
  - All tests pass for both AddSpiderButton and Rainbow components.

- **Documentation & Process:**
  - Updated `spider-component-plan.md` with a Development Notes section to document the rainbow refactor and button styling changes.
  - Updated `preferences.md` to clarify the workflow: only one file should be changed at a time, but multiple changes per file are allowed, and each change should be explained.
  - Used git best practices: staged and committed code and asset changes in logical, separate commits.

### Current State

- **Component Status:**
  - The Rainbow component is now responsible for rendering the rainbow image.
  - The AddSpiderButton is larger and positioned within the rainbow layout container, but its alignment with the left cloud is not yet correct.
  - All component tests are passing.

- **Development Infrastructure:**
  - Jest is configured to handle static asset imports as ES modules.
  - The codebase is organized with clear separation between components, tests, and mocks.
  - Preferences and component plan documentation are up to date.

- **UI/UX:**
  - The rainbow is displayed as a React component, but there is still excess whitespace around it.
  - The AddSpiderButton is not yet visually aligned with the left cloud; further adjustments are needed.

### Technical Decisions

- **Rainbow Refactor:**  
  - Chose to replace the CSS/HTML background image with a React component to allow precise positioning of UI elements and improve maintainability.
  - Considered keeping the background image, but found it too limiting for responsive design and button alignment.
  - Trade-off: Slightly more code, but much greater flexibility and clarity.

- **Button Positioning:**  
  - Decided to use a relatively positioned container and absolutely position the button within it for fine-grained control.
  - Chose to remove the old `.lower-left` class and rely on the new layout for alignment.
  - Trade-off: Requires more CSS tuning, but results in a more robust and adaptable layout.

- **Testing & Mocks:**  
  - Updated Jest configuration to use ES module syntax for file mocks, ensuring compatibility with the project's module system.
  - Added a dedicated test for the Rainbow component to maintain TDD discipline.

- **Process Documentation:**  
  - Updated preferences and component plan documentation to reflect the new workflow and design decisions, ensuring future work remains consistent and well-documented.

### Today's Next Steps

- Continue fine-tuning the AddSpiderButton's position and size for optimal alignment with the rainbow/cloud.
- Reduce excess whitespace around the rainbow for a more compact and visually appealing layout.
- Begin implementing the next chunk of the spider component plan (toggle functionality or spider display, as appropriate).

### Previous Next Steps

- Implement Chunk 3: Toggle functionality between "Add spider?" and "Remove spider?" (from 05-11)
- Continue the chunked implementation approach following the plan document (from 05-11)
- Explore potential for public blog generation from journal entries (from 05-10)
- Add more React components to enhance the UI (from 05-10)
- Implement test coverage reporting (from 05-10)
- Create a development roadmap with milestones (from 05-10)

### Preparation for Next Session

- Review the spider-component-plan.md document for detailed requirements and next implementation chunks.
- Plan for further UI/UX improvements and additional component integration.

### Accomplishments
- **Component Development**:
  - Built the first version of the AddSpiderButton that appears in the lower left corner
  - Added proper styling with black text on white background and outline
  - Integrated a custom spider font to match the design specs
  - Created detailed tests for each feature before implementation
  - Followed strict TDD methodology throughout development
  - Replaced the previous SpiderButton with the new implementation
  - Added necessary assets including Spider.png and custom font files

- **Journal System Improvements**:
  - Completely revamped how the journal system works:
    - Switched from git hook reminders at 3pm to simpler terminal notifications at 5pm
    - Created a dedicated instructions document for consistency
    - Split Next Steps into today's tasks and previous items
    - Added date tracking to show how old carried-over tasks are
    - Flag and remove older items automatically (8+ and 10+ entries)
  - Added a Technical Decisions section to document the "why" behind technical choices
  - Implemented anti-hallucination guidelines to ensure factual accuracy
  - Updated all documentation to reflect the new structure
  - Improved journal structure with thematic grouping for better organization
  - Added natural language guidelines to make entries more readable
  - Enhanced instructions to prevent incorrect future-date entries
  - Set up environment variable for date verification and consistency
  - Made technical documentation clearer with specific examples

- **Development Process Refinements**:
  - Established a chunked development approach for more manageable progress
  - Added visual verification checkpoints between implementation phases
  - Created a more disciplined git workflow with commits after each completed chunk

### Current State
- **Component Status**:
  - AddSpiderButton is partially implemented with proper positioning and styling
  - Custom font integration is working correctly
  - Test suite is passing for all implemented features
  - Ready for next implementation chunks (toggle, spider display, opacity)

- **Development Infrastructure**:
  - Project is following TDD methodology throughout
  - Implementation plan document guides the remaining work
  - Visual verification checkpoints are in place between chunks
  - Chunked approach is working well for manageable progress

- **Journal System Status**:

  - Documentation is fully updated and consistent across files

### Technical Decisions
- **Chunked Implementation Approach for AddSpiderButton**:
  - Decided to implement the component in distinct chunks rather than all at once
  - Benefits include easier testing, more frequent working states, and clearer progress tracking
  - Trade-off accepted: slightly longer total implementation time versus simpler testing
  
- **Journal System Enhancement Strategy**:
  - Selected a three-component architecture (Reminder, Instructions, Statistics) for separation of concerns
  - Chose terminal-only notifications over system alerts for simplicity and reliability
  - Implemented date tagging format (MM-DD) based on balance between brevity and clarity
  - Selected 8+ entries threshold for [Old] flag based on typical task lifecycle
  
- **Technical Decisions Section Addition**:
  - Implemented as a standalone section rather than integrating with Accomplishments to separate what was done from why
  - Added specific validation in the anti-hallucination guidelines to prevent fabrication of decision rationales
  - Maintained backward compatibility by including instructions to always add this section even if previous entries don't have it

- **Journal Improvements for Error Prevention**:
  - Added environment variable approach for storing and referencing today's date
