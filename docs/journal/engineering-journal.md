### Accomplishments
- **Applied strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology** throughout the day:
  - Wrote tests first, verified they failed, then implemented code to make them pass
  - Created multiple test cases before each implementation phase
  - Maintained disciplined development process with clear separation of test and implementation
- Implemented the AddSpiderButton component following TDD principles:
  - Created a comprehensive implementation plan with chunked development approach
  - Implemented Chunk 1: Button rendering and positioning
  - Added tests to verify button rendering, position, and styling
  - Implemented Chunk 2: Font integration with custom spider-font.ttf
  - Set up @font-face declaration and proper CSS classes for the font
- Improved the journal system with streamlined reminders and comprehensive instructions:
  - Changed from git hook-based 3pm reminder to terminal-only 5pm reminder
  - Modified system infrastructure to simplify the reminder process
  - Created JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md with detailed formatting guidelines
  - Updated documentation in JOURNAL_REMINDER.md and JOURNAL_SYSTEM.md
  - Split Next Steps into "Today's Next Steps" and "Previous Next Steps"
  - Added date tagging system to track item age
  - Established rules for flagging and removing older items
  - Commit: "Improve journal system with streamlined reminders and comprehensive instructions"
- Previously updated the journal reminder system:
  - Earlier commit: "Update journal system"
- Updated the development process in the implementation plan to include:
  - Git commits after each successfully completed chunk
  - Visual verification for font integration before proceeding to next chunks
- Removed previous SpiderButton implementation (replaced with AddSpiderButton)
- Added Spider.png image and custom spider font for the application
- Created detailed test cases using Jest and React Testing Library

### Current State
- AddSpiderButton component is partially implemented with:
  - Proper positioning in the lower left corner
  - Correct styling (black text, white background and outline)
  - Custom font integration
- Test suite passing for the implemented chunks
- Implementation plan document provides clear guidance for remaining work
- Project is following TDD methodology with tests written before implementation
- Journal system now features:
  - Streamlined terminal-only approach at 5pm
  - Comprehensive JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md document with copyable prompt
  - Clear separation of immediate and carried-over tasks
  - Age tracking for previous next steps
- Remaining chunks to implement:
  - Chunk 3: Toggle functionality
  - Chunk 4: Spider display
  - Chunk 5: Rainbow opacity changes

### Today's Next Steps
- Integrate the AddSpiderButton component into App.jsx for visual verification
- Implement Chunk 3: Toggle functionality between "Add spider?" and "Remove spider?"
- Continue the chunked implementation approach following the plan document

### Previous Next Steps
- Explore potential for public blog generation from journal entries (from 05-10)
- Add more React components to enhance the UI (from 05-10)
- Implement test coverage reporting (from 05-10)
- Create a development roadmap with milestones (from 05-10)

### Preparation for Next Session
- Review the spider-component-plan.md document for detailed requirements
- Familiarize with React state management for implementing toggle functionality
- Plan for image integration in the next chunks of work

- Changed the default port from 5173 to 8080 to align with DevOps standards
- Implemented a health monitoring server with proper signal handling
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library for test-driven development
- Created tests for the SpiderButton component (implementation pending)
- Added rainbow background with proper aspect ratio preservation
- Fixed favicon display issues
- Added auto timestamp updates to preferences.md
- Implemented graceful shutdown handling for containerization
- Developed and implemented a comprehensive journal system with:
  - Journal reminder script that checks for git activity
  - Git post-commit hook for reminders after 3pm
  - Full documentation with clear guidelines
- Enhanced the journal system with:
  - Comprehensive entry requirements
  - Data integrity guidelines
  - Weekly statistics feature

- Journal system is fully implemented with:
  - Daily entry reminders
  - Weekly statistics generation
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Data integrity safeguards
- Documentation is comprehensive and well-organized in the docs/ directory
- UI has basic styling with proper image handling
- Project structure follows best practices with clear separation of concerns

### Next Steps
- Implement the SpiderButton component that currently has tests but no implementation
- Explore potential for public blog generation from journal entries
- Add more React components to enhance the UI
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Create a development roadmap with milestones

### Preparation for Next Session
- Review the SpiderButton.test.jsx file to understand requirements
- Familiarize with test-driven development approach being used in the project
- Study existing components for code style and conventions
- Explore React 19 features that could be leveraged in the project
