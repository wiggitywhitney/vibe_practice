### Accomplishments

- **Task Completion & Testing (Task 9):**
    - Successfully created and implemented integration tests for the spider display logic in `src/__tests__/SpiderIntegration.test.jsx`.
    - The tests cover both regular and surprise spider scenarios, including button toggling and ensuring correct spider types are displayed/hidden.
    - Utilized the `mockRandom` utility to ensure deterministic behavior for these tests.
    - All tests for Task 9 are passing.
    - Marked Task 9 as "done" in Taskmaster.

- **Repository Maintenance:**
    - Synced all changes related to Task 9 completion to the remote Git repository with the commit message "feat: Add integration tests for spider display (Task 9)".

### Current State

- **Application Functionality:**
    - Core spider display logic is now covered by integration tests, verifying its behavior with `mockRandom`.
- **Task Management:**
    - Task 9 (Write Integration Tests for Spider Display Logic) is "done".
- **Repository Status:**
    - Working tree clean. Branch `main` is up to date with `origin/main`.

### Technical Decisions

- **Integration Test Assertions (Task 9):**
    - Added explicit assertions in `SpiderIntegration.test.jsx` to check that when one type of spider is displayed, the other type is *not* present, and that no spiders are rendered initially. This provides more robust verification of the display logic.

### Today's Next Steps

- Determine and begin work on the next task suggested by Taskmaster.

### Previous Next Steps

- Begin implementing Phase 1 of the statistics system refactoring plan (from 05-12)
- Explore potential for public blog generation from journal entries (from 05-10)
- Add more React components to enhance the UI (from 05-10)
- Implement test coverage reporting (from 05-10)

### Preparation for Next Session

## 2025-05-14

### Accomplishments

- **Task Completion & Testing:**
    - Successfully created the `mockRandom` utility (Task 8) in `src/utils/testUtils.js`.
    - Implemented Jest tests for `mockRandom` in `src/__tests__/utils/testUtils.test.js` and confirmed they pass.
    - Successfully developed and finalized integration tests for Rainbow component opacity changes (Task 10) in `src/__tests__/RainbowOpacity.test.jsx`. The process involved iterative debugging:
        - Systematically identified and corrected import path errors for `App.jsx` and `testUtils.js` that initially prevented tests from running.
        - Resolved test failures by refining DOM element selectors for opacity checks, correctly targeting `.rainbow-container` where styles were applied, instead of `.rainbow-image`.
        - Further enhanced test robustness by incorporating `toBeInTheDocument` assertions.
    - Marked Task 8 and Task 10 as "done" in Taskmaster.

- **Repository Maintenance:**
    - Removed an empty and unused directory: `src/components/__tests__/`.
    - Synced all changes related to Task 8 and Task 10 to the remote Git repository in separate, well-defined commits.

- **Journal Refinement:**
    - Consolidated the two previous `2025-05-13` entries in `docs/journal/engineering-journal.md` into a single, comprehensive entry, preserving all information and adhering to established formatting.

### Current State

- **Application Functionality:**
    - The `mockRandom` utility is available for deterministic testing.
    - Tests for Rainbow component opacity are implemented and passing, verifying its dynamic behavior.
- **Task Management:**
    - Task 8 (Create `mockRandom` Test Utility) is "done".
    - Task 10 (Test Rainbow Opacity Integration) is "done".
    - The next suggested task is Task 9 (Write Integration Tests for Spider Display Logic).
- **Repository Status:**
    - The following file is modified and uncommitted:
        - `docs/journal/engineering-journal.md` (due to 2025-05-13 entry consolidation and this new entry)
    - All other changes from today's session have been committed and pushed.

### Technical Decisions

- **Test Utility Implementation (Task 8):**
    - Created `mockRandom` in `src/utils/testUtils.js` as specified, enabling controlled testing of random behaviors.
- **Opacity Test Refinement (Task 10):**
    - Switched from querying `.rainbow-image` to `.rainbow-container` for opacity style checks in tests, as the style is applied to the container div. This resolved initial test failures.
    - Added `expect(element).toBeInTheDocument()` assertions before style checks in `RainbowOpacity.test.jsx` for increased test robustness, ensuring elements exist before their styles are interrogated.
- **Journal Consolidation:**
    - Merged the two `2025-05-13` journal entries to maintain a clean and chronological record, ensuring all details from both versions were preserved under the correct headers.

### Today's Next Steps

- Commit the changes to `docs/journal/engineering-journal.md` (the 2025-05-13 merge and this new 2025-05-14 entry).
- Begin work on Task 9: Write Integration Tests for Spider Display Logic.

### Previous Next Steps

- Begin work on Task 10: Test Rainbow Opacity Integration (from 2025-05-13) - *Completed today*
- Begin implementing Phase 1 of the statistics system refactoring plan (from 05-12)
- Explore potential for public blog generation from journal entries (from 05-10)
- Add more React components to enhance the UI (from 05-10)
- Implement test coverage reporting (from 05-10)

### Preparation for Next Session

- Review Task 9 details: Write Integration Tests for Spider Display Logic.
- Prepare to create `src/__tests__/SpiderIntegration.test.jsx`.
- Ensure `mockRandom` utility is correctly imported and used for these integration tests.

## 2025-05-13

### Accomplishments

- **Component Development & Refinement:**
  - Implemented the `SpiderImage` component (`src/components/SpiderImage.jsx`, `src/components/SpiderImage.css`) and its corresponding tests (`src/__tests__/components/SpiderImage.test.jsx`), ensuring correct rendering, styling, and responsive behavior based on the `rainbowWidth` prop. The TDD process was followed, with tests created first, then the component implementation to make them pass.
  - Updated the `AddSpiderButton` component (`src/components/AddSpiderButton.jsx`) to correctly implement toggle functionality, displaying "Add spider?" or "Remove spider?" based on the `isSpiderPresent` prop. Associated tests in `src/__tests__/components/AddSpiderButton.test.jsx` were updated to cover this new behavior and ensure proper click handling. The component structure was also refined to include a container `div` (`add-spider-container`) and iterative CSS adjustments were made to ensure correct application of positioning styles defined in `AddSpiderButton.css`, restoring its intended appearance and alignment.
  - Created the `SurpriseSpider` component (`src/components/SurpriseSpider.jsx`, `src/components/SurpriseSpider.css`) along with its tests (`src/__tests__/components/SurpriseSpider.test.jsx`). This component displays a different spider image, styled to take the full width of its `rainbowWidth` prop.
  - Modified the `Rainbow` component (`src/components/Rainbow.jsx`) to accept an `isSpiderPresent` prop and adjust its opacity to 75% when a spider is present, and 100% otherwise. This involved updating the component logic and its tests (`src/__tests__/components/Rainbow.test.jsx`). A new CSS file (`src/components/Rainbow.css`) was created and imported to support its styling.
  - Resolved various import and rendering issues, such as ensuring `AddSpiderButton` was imported as a default export in `App.jsx` and creating `Rainbow.css` when it was missing.

- **Application Integration & Refinement (Task 7):**
  - Successfully integrated `SpiderImage` and `SurpriseSpider` components into `App.jsx`, ensuring conditional rendering based on `selectSpiderType` and correct passing of `rainbowWidth`.
  - Resolved issues with `rainbowWidth` calculation by implementing `React.forwardRef` in the `Rainbow` component, allowing `App.jsx` to correctly obtain the Rainbow's `offsetWidth`. This fixed the bug where spiders were rendered with 0 width.
  - Verified that `AddSpiderButton` correctly toggles spider visibility and updates its text.
  - Confirmed that the `Rainbow` component's opacity changes as expected when a spider is present.
  - Cleaned up debugging `console.log` statements from `App.jsx`, `SpiderImage.jsx`, and `SurpriseSpider.jsx`.
  - All functional requirements for Task 7 (Implement Main App Component Integration) were completed and verified.

- **Testing Infrastructure & Process:**
  - Standardized the location for component tests to `src/__tests__/components/`. This involved moving `SpiderImage.test.jsx` and ensuring future component tests follow this convention.
  - Updated Taskmaster tasks (Task 3: `SpiderImage`, Task 4: `SurpriseSpider`) to reflect the correct test file paths.

- **Task Management:**
  - Added a new task (Task 13: Refine `AddSpiderButton` styling) to address the button overlapping the `SurpriseSpider` image and to make its background transparent.
  - Marked Task 7 as "done".

- **Version Control:**
  - Synced all changes related to Task 7 completion, Jest configuration, and new task addition to the remote repository. The commit message was: "feat: Complete app integration and add button styling task".

- **Journaling Process & Documentation:**
  - Further refined `docs/journal/JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to provide more explicit guidance on several key aspects of the journaling process. This included:
    - Emphasizing the requirement to *augment* existing entries for the current day rather than completely replacing them, to ensure all prior details and nuances are preserved while integrating new information.
    - Clarifying the conditional inclusion of the "Repository Status" subsection: it should only be present if `git status` indicates uncommitted changes or a divergence from the remote branch, and omitted entirely otherwise.
  - Iteratively updated the journal entry for `2025-05-13` based on these refined instructions, focusing on correctly applying the augmentation and "Repository Status" rules.
  - Previously, `docs/journal/JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` was updated to include a rule for using Taskmaster to help populate the "Today's Next Steps" section.

- **Knowledge Management & AI Tooling:**
  - Updated the project's internal knowledge graph, likely within `memory.json` or a similar system, by incorporating specific strategies and guidelines designed to prevent AI tools from generating inaccurate or misleading information. These "anti-hallucination" measures are intended to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-assisted development processes within the project.

### Current State

- **Application Functionality:**
  - The main application integrates all core components (`Rainbow`, `AddSpiderButton`, `SpiderImage`, `SurpriseSpider`).
  - Spiders (both regular and surprise) are correctly rendered with appropriate sizes based on the rainbow's width.
  - Rainbow opacity changes correctly based on spider visibility.
  - Button text updates correctly.

- **Component Status (from original entry, confirming alignment with Application Functionality):**
  - `SpiderImage`: Implemented and tested. Displays correctly.
  - `AddSpiderButton`: Toggle functionality implemented and tested. Styling and positioning are correct.
  - `SurpriseSpider`: Implemented and tested. Displays correctly.
  - `Rainbow`: Opacity modification based on `isSpiderPresent` prop is implemented and tested. Associated CSS file created.
  - All component tests are passing.
  - The application renders correctly in the browser, displaying the rainbow and the "Add spider?" button.

- **Testing Infrastructure:**
  - Test file locations are standardized under `src/__tests__/components/`.


- **Documentation:**
  - `JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` has been significantly updated with more explicit rules, particularly concerning how to handle updates to existing daily entries (favoring augmentation over replacement) and the conditions for including or omitting the "Repository Status" section.

- **Knowledge Management:**
  - The project's internal knowledge base for AI tooling now includes enhanced anti-hallucination guidelines.


### Technical Decisions

- **Test File Organization:**
  - Decided to centralize component tests within `src/__tests__/components/` rather than co-locating them directly with components (e.g., `src/components/__tests__/`) or in a single top-level `src/__tests__/` directory. This was chosen to maintain a clear separation between source code and test code while still grouping tests by their relevant component, aiming for a balance between organization and ease of navigation. Future component-related tasks were updated to reflect this structure.

- **Styling Restoration for `AddSpiderButton`:**
  - The `AddSpiderButton` component was modified to include an outer `div` with the class `add-spider-container`, and CSS was iteratively refined. This was done because the CSS rules for positioning (e.g., `position: absolute`) were defined on this container class and needed adjustment for visual harmony. Without the `div` and these specific styles in the component's JSX and CSS, the button was not being positioned as intended. This change restored and refined the visual layout.

- **Resolving Blank Screen Issue:**
  - Investigated a blank screen error by first checking for CSS import issues, then by examining the browser console. The console revealed a `SyntaxError` due to an incorrect named import of `AddSpiderButton` in `App.jsx`. Correcting this to a default import resolved the error and allowed the application to render.

- **Ref Forwarding for `Rainbow` Component (from Augmented Entry):**
  - Modified the `Rainbow` component to use `React.forwardRef`. This was critical to allow `App.jsx` to obtain a ref to the `Rainbow`'s underlying DOM element and accurately measure its `offsetWidth`. Without this, `rainbowWidth` was consistently `0` initially, preventing spider components from rendering with a visible size.

- **Journaling Instruction Refinement:**
  - Based on iterative feedback, the decision was made to make the rules in `JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` highly explicit, particularly concerning how to handle updates to existing daily entries (favoring augmentation over replacement) and the conditions for including or omitting the "Repository Status" section. This aims to reduce ambiguity and improve the consistency of journal entries.

- **Knowledge Graph Enhancement:**
  - The addition of anti-hallucination strategies to the knowledge graph was a proactive step to improve the quality of AI-generated outputs. This decision reflects a focus on ensuring the reliability of AI tools used in the development workflow, rather than exploring alternative knowledge management systems at this juncture.

### Today's Next Steps

- Begin work on Task 10: Test Rainbow Opacity Integration.

### Previous Next Steps

## 05-12

### Accomplishments

- **Journal System Improvements:**
  - Created a comprehensive refactoring plan for the journal statistics system
  - Identified key issues with current statistics implementation
  - Designed a solution that separates statistics from daily entries
  - Established clear goals and execution phases
  - Documented the plan in `docs/STATISTICS_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`
  - Refined journal instructions (`docs/journal/JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) for clarity and granularity (committed later in the day).

- **Component Development & Refactoring:**
  - Refactored the rainbow background from a CSS/HTML background image to a dedicated `Rainbow` React component that renders the PNG image.
  - Integrated the `Rainbow` component into the app and visually verified its appearance.
  - Adjusted the layout to wrap the rainbow and AddSpiderButton in a new container for better positioning.
  - Increased the size of the AddSpiderButton for improved visibility.
  - Removed the old `.lower-left` positioning and set up the button for relative positioning within the new layout.
  - Iteratively adjusted CSS to begin improving the button's alignment with the left cloud.
  - Restored desired absolute positioning styles for the `.add-spider-button` in `src/App.css` after troubleshooting (committed later).

- **Testing:**
  - Created a new test file for the Rainbow component to verify it renders the image with the correct `src` and `alt` attributes.
  - Updated Jest configuration and file mocks to support image imports and ES module compatibility.
  - All tests pass for both AddSpiderButton and Rainbow components.

- **Documentation & Process:**
  - Updated `spider-component-plan.md` with a Development Notes section to document the rainbow refactor and button styling changes.
  - Updated `docs/preferences.md` to refine development process (granularity, numbering, approval) and terminal command (auto-run) rules.
  - Refined journal instructions (`docs/journal/JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md`) for clarity and granularity.
  - Significantly refocused `README.md` to emphasize AI tooling exploration (Cursor, Taskmaster, Context7, Memory) as the primary project goal, de-emphasizing the React app and journal system.

- **Preferences & Memory Management:**
  - Defined a list of key user preferences (excluding journaling) for storage in MCP memory.
  - Added the finalized preferences (including rules for Context7 usage, Taskmaster verification steps, and sequential task adding) to the MCP knowledge graph under the "User Preferences" entity.
  - Updated `memory.json` reflecting the MCP memory changes.

- **Taskmaster Troubleshooting & Setup:**
  - Diagnosed and resolved issues preventing Taskmaster tools (`add_task`) from recognizing the `tasks.json` file structure after initialization via MCP tools.
  - Manually created `tasks/tasks.json` with the structure `{\"tasks\": []}` based on user intervention, allowing task creation to proceed.
  - Created Taskmaster tasks (1-6) for the MCP memory update process.
  - Marked Taskmaster tasks (1-6) as done and generated corresponding task files.

- **Project Audit and Organization (Earlier Commits):**
  - Conducted a comprehensive audit of project files and Git status.
  - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files (`.cursor/mcp.json`, `.env`) and Taskmaster files (`tasks.json`, `tasks/`). Removed trailing space.
  - Committed necessary configuration files (`.taskmasterconfig`, `.cursor/rules/`, `memory.json`, `.roo/`, `.roomodes`).
  - Fixed a syntax error in `.cursor/mcp.json`.

- **Configuration & Tooling (Earlier Commits):**
  - Added/Committed Taskmaster, Cursor rules, Memory, and Roo Code configurations.

### Current State

- **MCP Memory:**
  - Key user preferences (DevOps, Git, Dev Process, Terminal, UI/UX, Communication, Tooling rules) are stored in the knowledge graph under "User Preferences".

- **Documentation:**
  - `docs/preferences.md` is updated with refined development process and terminal command rules.
  - `docs/journal/JOURNAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` has updated granularity guidelines.
  - `spider-component-plan.md` has updated development notes.
  - `README.md` is updated to reflect the focus on AI tooling experimentation.

- **Taskmaster:**
  - Setup is functional after manual `tasks.json` creation.
  - Tasks related to the memory update are complete.
  - `tasks.json` and `tasks/` directory are correctly ignored by Git.

- **Journal System Status:**
  - Statistics refactoring plan is documented and ready for implementation
  - Plan addresses key issues with current statistics system
  - Clear separation of concerns between daily entries and statistics
  - Ready to begin implementation of new statistics system

- **Component Status:**
  - The Rainbow component is now responsible for rendering the rainbow image.
  - The AddSpiderButton is larger and positioned within the rainbow layout container, using restored absolute positioning styles.
  - All component tests are passing.

- **Development Infrastructure:**
  - Jest is configured to handle static asset imports as ES modules.
  - The codebase is organized with clear separation between components, tests, and mocks.
  - Preferences and component plan documentation are up to date.

- **UI/UX:**
  - The rainbow is displayed as a React component.
  - The AddSpiderButton alignment relative to the rainbow/cloud may still need fine-tuning.
  - Potential excess whitespace around the rainbow remains.

### Technical Decisions

- **MCP Memory Update Process:**
  - Opted to store key preferences directly in MCP memory to ensure consistent application across sessions.
  - Chose a collaborative approach, confirming the exact preference strings with the user before storage.
  - Bypassed initially failing Taskmaster MCP tools by manually creating `tasks/tasks.json` based on user input, enabling subsequent Taskmaster operations.

- **Preference Refinement (Development Process):**
  - Differentiated interaction granularity based on task type (Application Code vs. Other Tasks) for better workflow efficiency.
  - Mandated numbering for grouped changes to improve clarity during review.
  - Clarified that approval is needed for application file changes, while info gathering is exempt.

- **Preference Refinement (Terminal):**
  - Updated preference to allow automatic execution of terminal commands by tools, removing previous restrictions.

- **Preference Refinement (Tooling):**
  - Added explicit preferences to always use Context7 for documentation lookups and to include verification steps in Taskmaster plans.
  - Added preference to allow sequential Taskmaster task additions without individual confirmation after plan approval.

- **Statistics System Refactoring:**
  - Chose to separate statistics entries into their own file to preserve daily journal functionality
  - Decided to follow the same AI-assisted pattern as the daily journal system
  - Selected a phased implementation approach to manage complexity
  - Trade-off: More files to manage, but better separation of concerns and preserved functionality

- **Rainbow Refactor:**  
  - Chose to replace the CSS/HTML background image with a React component to allow precise positioning of UI elements and improve maintainability.
  - Considered keeping the background image, but found it too limiting for responsive design and button alignment.
  - Trade-off: Slightly more code, but much greater flexibility and clarity.

- **Button Positioning:**  
  - Decided to use a relatively positioned container and initially attempt absolute positioning within it.
  - Later restored absolute positioning for `.add-spider-button` in `App.css` after troubleshooting layout issues.
  - Trade-off: Requires more CSS tuning, but results in a more robust and adaptable layout.

- **Testing & Mocks:**  
  - Updated Jest configuration to use ES module syntax for file mocks, ensuring compatibility with the project's module system.
  - Added a dedicated test for the Rainbow component to maintain TDD discipline.

- **Process Documentation:**  
  - Updated preferences and component plan documentation to reflect the new workflow and design decisions, ensuring future work remains consistent and well-documented.

- **Ignoring Files:**
  - Added `.cursor/mcp.json` and Taskmaster files to `.gitignore`.

- **Committing Config Files:**
  - Committed Roo Code, Taskmaster, Cursor rules configurations.

- **Journaling Process Refinement:**
  - Based on user feedback, further refined the understanding of journal granularity. Specifically, explicit git actions (like individual commits or pushes) should not be listed as separate accomplishments unless they mark a very significant milestone or a decision point in themselves. The focus should remain on the substance of the work, with commits being an inherent part of that workflow rather than standalone reportable items.

### Today's Next Steps

- Begin implementing Phase 1 of the statistics system refactoring plan
- Continue fine-tuning the AddSpiderButton's position and size for optimal alignment with the rainbow/cloud
- Reduce excess whitespace around the rainbow for a more compact and visually appealing layout
- Begin implementing the next chunk of the spider component plan (toggle functionality or spider display, as appropriate)

### Previous Next Steps

- Implement Chunk 3: Toggle functionality between "Add spider?" and "Remove spider?" (from 05-11)
- Continue the chunked implementation approach following the plan document (from 05-11)
