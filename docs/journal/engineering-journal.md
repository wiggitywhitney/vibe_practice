### Accomplishments
- **Component Development**:
  - Built the first version of the AddSpiderButton that appears in the lower left corner
  - Added proper styling with black text on white background and outline
  - Integrated a custom spider font to match the design specs
  - Created detailed tests for each feature before implementation
  - Followed strict TDD methodology throughout development
  - Replaced the previous SpiderButton with the new implementation
  - Added necessary assets including Spider.png and custom font files

- **Journal System Improvements**:
  - Completely revamped how the journal system works:
    - Switched from git hook reminders at 3pm to simpler terminal notifications at 5pm
    - Created a dedicated instructions document for consistency
    - Split Next Steps into today's tasks and previous items
    - Added date tracking to show how old carried-over tasks are
    - Flag and remove older items automatically (8+ and 10+ entries)
  - Added a Technical Decisions section to document the "why" behind technical choices
  - Implemented anti-hallucination guidelines to ensure factual accuracy
  - Updated all documentation to reflect the new structure

- **Development Process Refinements**:
  - Established a chunked development approach for more manageable progress
  - Added visual verification checkpoints between implementation phases
  - Created a more disciplined git workflow with commits after each completed chunk

### Current State
- **Component Status**:
  - AddSpiderButton is partially implemented with proper positioning and styling
  - Custom font integration is working correctly
  - Test suite is passing for all implemented features
  - Ready for next implementation chunks (toggle, spider display, opacity)

- **Development Infrastructure**:
  - Project is following TDD methodology throughout
  - Implementation plan document guides the remaining work
  - Visual verification checkpoints are in place between chunks
  - Chunked approach is working well for manageable progress

- **Journal System Status**:
  - Using streamlined terminal-only notifications at 5pm
  - Comprehensive instructions document provides consistent formatting
  - Next Steps management includes date tracking and clean-up rules
  - Technical Decisions section captures implementation reasoning
  - Anti-hallucination guidelines ensure factual content

### Technical Decisions
- **Chunked Implementation Approach for AddSpiderButton**:
  - Decided to implement the component in distinct chunks rather than all at once
  - Benefits include easier testing, more frequent working states, and clearer progress tracking
  - Trade-off accepted: slightly longer total implementation time versus simpler testing
  
- **Journal System Enhancement Strategy**:
  - Selected a three-component architecture (Reminder, Instructions, Statistics) for separation of concerns
  - Chose terminal-only notifications over system alerts for simplicity and reliability
  - Implemented date tagging format (MM-DD) based on balance between brevity and clarity
  - Selected 8+ entries threshold for [Old] flag based on typical task lifecycle
  
- **Technical Decisions Section Addition**:
  - Implemented as a standalone section rather than integrating with Accomplishments to separate what was done from why
  - Added specific validation in the anti-hallucination guidelines to prevent fabrication of decision rationales
  - Maintained backward compatibility by including instructions to always add this section even if previous entries don't have it

### Today's Next Steps
- Integrate the AddSpiderButton component into App.jsx for visual verification
- Implement Chunk 3: Toggle functionality between "Add spider?" and "Remove spider?"
- Continue the chunked implementation approach following the plan document

### Previous Next Steps
- Explore potential for public blog generation from journal entries (from 05-10)
- Add more React components to enhance the UI (from 05-10)
- Implement test coverage reporting (from 05-10)
- Create a development roadmap with milestones (from 05-10)

### Preparation for Next Session
- Review the spider-component-plan.md document for detailed requirements
- Familiarize with React state management for implementing toggle functionality
- Plan for image integration in the next chunks of work

### Accomplishments
- Created a new React 19 application with Vite as the build system
- Changed the default port from 5173 to 8080 to align with DevOps standards
- Implemented a health monitoring server with proper signal handling
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library for test-driven development
- Created tests for the SpiderButton component (implementation pending)
- Added rainbow background with proper aspect ratio preservation
- Fixed favicon display issues
- Added auto timestamp updates to preferences.md
- Implemented graceful shutdown handling for containerization
- Developed and implemented a comprehensive journal system with:
  - Journal reminder script that checks for git activity

  - Full documentation with clear guidelines
- Enhanced the journal system with:
  - Comprehensive entry requirements
  - Data integrity guidelines
  - Weekly statistics feature
  - Documentation of all components

### Current State
- Project is set up with modern React 19 and Vite
- Health monitoring server is operational with proper DevOps practices
- Testing infrastructure is in place following TDD methodology
- Journal system is fully implemented with:
  - Daily entry reminders
  - Weekly statistics generation
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Data integrity safeguards
- Documentation is comprehensive and well-organized in the docs/ directory
- UI has basic styling with proper image handling
- Project structure follows best practices with clear separation of concerns

### Next Steps
- Implement the SpiderButton component that currently has tests but no implementation
- Explore potential for public blog generation from journal entries
- Add more React components to enhance the UI
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Create a development roadmap with milestones

### Preparation for Next Session
- Review the SpiderButton.test.jsx file to understand requirements
