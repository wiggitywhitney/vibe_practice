# User Preferences

## Project Setup
- Initialize Git repository for every new project
- Connect to GitHub using GitHub CLI (gh)
- Set up hot reloading for development
- Make no assumptions about programming languages or technologies

## Git & GitHub Workflow
- Regular commits after major changes
- Commits approximately every 30 minutes
- Use GitHub CLI for all GitHub interactions

## Development Process
- Ask for confirmation before implementing each individual step
- Propose one change at a time and wait for my acceptance
- Never implement multiple features at once without explicit approval
- Break down larger tasks but wait for approval on each subtask

## Terminal Commands
- Provide copy buttons for all terminal commands
- Do NOT run commands automatically - allow manual copy/paste into terminal
- Never assume command execution is desired

## UI/UX Preferences
- Always preserve image aspect ratios - never stretch images (includes favicons, icons, and all UI elements)
- Use appropriate sizing methods (contain/cover) based on context
- Pay special attention to favicons and small UI elements that browsers might automatically resize

## File Management
- Add images directly to appropriate directories (public, assets, etc.) rather than through chat
- Prefer manual file uploads to ensure proper formatting and avoid corruption

## Communication Style
- Provide detailed explanations for each step
- Evaluate requests against best practices
- Suggest better alternatives when appropriate
- Break complex tasks into manageable subtasks

## Context & Experience
- Coming back to application development after 5 years in DevOps
- Need progressive complexity with clear explanations
- Want guidance on modern patterns and practices
- Will indicate if explanations become overwhelming

## Documentation
- Keep this preferences.md file updated as new preferences are discovered
- This file is public and committed to the repository as a reference

## Quality Assurance
- Double-check that all implementations follow the preferences in this file
- Verify image aspect ratios are preserved in all contexts
- Explicitly mention when a trade-off is necessary that might conflict with preferences
