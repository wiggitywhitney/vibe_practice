      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CSS optimization task into specific subtasks for each component, including: 1) App container whitespace reduction, 2) Rainbow component margin/padding optimization, and 3) Spider components layout refinement. For each subtask, specify the exact CSS properties to modify, expected visual outcomes, and verification steps.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward CSS optimization task with clear implementation details already provided. The complexity is low as it involves modifying existing CSS properties rather than creating new functionality. The task is well-defined with specific code examples, making it easy to implement and test visually."

      "taskTitle": "Create Visual Regression Tests",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the visual regression testing implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up Jest snapshot testing infrastructure, 2) Creating component-level snapshot tests, 3) Implementing full App state snapshot tests with mocking, and 4) Integrating visual regression tests into the CI pipeline. For each subtask, specify the implementation details, expected outcomes, and verification criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a comprehensive visual regression testing framework, which requires understanding of Jest snapshot testing, mocking techniques, and integration with CI. The complexity is medium as it requires creating tests for multiple components in various states and ensuring deterministic rendering. The detailed code example provides a good starting point, but proper implementation requires careful consideration of test coverage and maintenance."

      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AddSpiderButton styling refinement into subtasks addressing: 1) Background transparency implementation across all button states, 2) Z-index and positioning adjustments for proper component layering, 3) Text legibility enhancements with white outline/border implementation, and 4) Cross-browser and responsive testing. For each subtask, specify the CSS properties to modify, implementation approach, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple styling considerations including transparency, z-index management, text legibility, and cross-browser compatibility. The complexity is medium as it requires careful CSS implementation to ensure the button works correctly in various scenarios, especially when overlapping with other components. The task requires both technical implementation and visual design considerations, with comprehensive testing across different environments."
